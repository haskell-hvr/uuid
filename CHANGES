1.3.4

- Allow building against newer QuickCheck.

1.3.3

- More complex version constrainsts on hashable, to avoid building against
  versions less than 1.1.1.0 or equal to 1.2.0.*.

1.3.2

- Fix for building against bytestring 0.9.*

1.3.1

- Allow building against 'hashable' 1.1.* in addition to 1.2.*

1.3.0

- New functions for parsing and printing UUIDs to and from ASCII BytesStrings
- New module Data.UUID.Util. This module includes the type 'UnpackedUUID',
  whose fields correspond to the UUID fields described in RFC 4122.
- The Storable instance now stores a UUID in host byte-order instead of
  big endian.
- There is now an instance for 'Hashable UUID'.

1.2.13

Benchmark only changes:

- Allow criterion 0.8.*

1.2.12

Test only changes:

- Allow QuickCheck 2.6.*

1.2.11

- Allow binary 0.7.*

1.2.10

- Allow cryptohash version 0.9.*
- Cleanup tests

1.2.9

- Bumped dependency on 'cryptohash'.

1.2.8

- Bumped various dependencies and cleaned up dependencies in general.

1.2.7

- Added stricter constraints on 'random' package.

1.2.6

- Add module 'V4' to direct attention to our Random instance

- In module 'V1' seed the generator with a random number
  if the hardware MAC address could not be discovered.

- Fix and cleanup various haddocks.

- In module docs, warn about MD5 use in Data.UUID.V3 and
  encourage the reader to use Data.UUID.V5 instead.

1.2.5

- Use 'cryptohash' package for MD5 and SHA1 instead of 'Crypto'

1.2.4

- Unpack Word32 values into UUID constructor.

- Update test suite to QuickCheck 2

- Bump other dependencies in tests/benchmarks

1.2.3

- The Read instance now drops leading spaces in the string to be parsed.
Thanks to Marc Ziegert for reporting this bug.

- The tests have moved over to the new Cabal test running framework.

1.2.2

- Add functions fromWords/toWords

The goal was to have a total function that can be used to construct
a UUID, primarily for use by uuid-th.

1.2.1

- Fix concurrency bug in Data.UUID.V1 (thanks to Neil Mitchell for reporting
and a test case)

1.2.0
  (Contributors: Antoine Latter & Mark Lentczner)

- added functions toByteString and fromByteString
- added 'nil' UUID
- added unit tests and benchmarks, built when configured -ftest
- major speed up of to/from functions (as well as in general)
- added version-3 generation (deterministic based on MD5)
- major changes to internal representation
	- now uses four strict Word32 values
	- internal ByteSource classes for easy construction (see Builder.hs)
- Storable instance now stores in memory as system libraries in C do:
    16 bytes derived from the network order of the fields, no matter what
    the host native endianess is.
- fixed bugs in V1 time and clock stepping, and V1 generated values
- builds cleanly under GHC's -Wall
- added CHANGES file

1.1.1

- no longer exporting 'null' from the prelude
- add 'null' predicate on UUIDs
- documentation fix (thanks Mark Lentczner)
